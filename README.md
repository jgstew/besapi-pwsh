# besapi-pwsh
a powershell module for interacting with BigFix REST APIs

I strongly recommend using the besapi python module instead: https://github.com/jgstew/besapi

This is a very basic powershell module that was tested with powershell core `pwsh` on macos.

Not sure if this is compatible with vanilla windows powershell, but it should work with powershell core on windows.

This module is NOT supported by me, but pull requests welcome. This is just a demo / proof of concept / starting point. Not all functionality is fully tested beyond what is in `example.ps1`.

## Example

see `example.ps1` for example usage
