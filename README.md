# besapi-pwsh
a powershell module for interacting with BigFix REST APIs

This is a very basic powershell module that was tested with powershell core `pwsh` on macos.

Not sure if this is compatible with vanilla windows powershell, but it should work with powershell core on windows.

This module is NOT supported by me, but pull requests welcome.
